I was an “impact surface abrasion technician” for a number of years. 
 This test is not really correct as as others have said the needle gun is for heavy scaling. 
 For example. Steel of iron that has seen much salt water for decades or a stock trailer chassis that has taken thousands of beasts on their last journey to the slaughter house. 
 The layers of  delaminating steel will just absorb the blast cleaning. Needle guns, lump hammers, cold chisels and even SDS drills with chisel attachments get the worst off. Then hit with an abrasive shot. Steel shot or copper slag. 

That blaster though looks like it wouldn’t clean the skin off rice pudding to be honest though. 

Still, good effort. Keep the videos coming.
